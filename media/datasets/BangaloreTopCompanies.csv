396,IndianMoney.com,4.2,457,174,--,Bengaluru,Investment & Asset Management,"In early 2008 Mr.Sudheer C.S (founder, MD and CEO of IndianMoney.com) happened to meet an auto driver while working in a top MNC Broking house. The auto driver told him that one of the sales persons from his organization has sold him an insurance policy promising that ""If you pay Rs 25,000 once, you will get back Rs 1 lakh after 3 years"". Mr. Sudheer knew there was no such policy available. When he read the policy document he realized that it was a Regular Premium ULIP policy, where customer has to pay Rs 25,000 each for 3 years. Based on the market performance, customer ""might"" get back Rs 50,000 or Rs 75,000 or Rs 1 lakh after 3 years. It was clear that the humble auto driver wasn't made aware of the terms and conditions and complete details of the policy. It was literally impossible for an auto driver in Bangalore to save Rs. 25,000 a year for the rest of the installments. This incident shook Mr. Sudheer, he knew that there was a need for genuine, honest and unbiased financial advice and he instantly started thinking for a solution to end this problem. That's when IndianMoney.com was conceptualized, to end the unethical sales practices which are mostly in practice in the Financial Services Industry. Mr. Sudheer paid Rs. 25,000 to the auto driver so that he at least recovers the money he had put into and also submitted his resignation to his CEO. Our Mission is to Eradicate Financial Illiteracy from the Country and to ensure that the common man is not misguided or cheated while buying different kinds of Financial Products."
